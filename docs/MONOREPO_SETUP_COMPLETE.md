# Monorepo Setup Complete ✅

The `nostra-contracts` repository has been successfully restructured as a **yarn workspace monorepo**.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Workspace Configuration
- ✅ Added `workspaces` field to root `package.json`
- ✅ Updated root scripts for workspace commands
- ✅ Configured for yarn workspaces (Yarn 1.x compatible)

### 2. Restructured Code
- ✅ Moved all contracts, tests, and scripts to `packages/contracts/`
- ✅ Created new SDK package in `packages/sdk/`
- ✅ Each package has its own `package.json`

### 3. Created SDK Package
- ✅ TypeScript SDK with proper configuration
- ✅ Placeholder for auto-generated addresses and ABIs
- ✅ Helper functions for contract interactions
- ✅ Complete type safety with ethers.js

### 4. Updated Documentation
- ✅ Updated `README.md` with new structure and commands
- ✅ Updated `SDK_ARCHITECTURE.md` with monorepo benefits
- ✅ Created `MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` for developers
- ✅ Created this summary document

### 5. Verified Everything Works
- ✅ All 77 tests passing
- ✅ Contracts compile successfully
- ✅ SDK structure is ready for development

## Quick Start

### For New Users

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd nostra-contracts

# Install all dependencies
yarn install

# Compile contracts
yarn compile

# Run tests
yarn test

# Build SDK
yarn sdk:build
```

### For Existing Users

If you have an existing clone, follow the [MIGRATION_GUIDE.md](./MIGRATION_GUIDE.md).

## Available Commands

### Root Level

```bash
yarn compile              # Compile contracts
yarn test                 # Run all tests
yarn test:unit            # Run unit tests
yarn test:integration     # Run integration tests
yarn sdk:build            # Build SDK
yarn sdk:dev              # Watch mode for SDK
yarn deploy:local         # Deploy to local network
yarn clean                # Clean all build artifacts
```

### Package-Specific

```bash
# Run tests in contracts package only
yarn workspace @nostra/contracts test

# Build SDK package only
yarn workspace @nostra/sdk build

# Run any script in a specific workspace
yarn workspace @nostra/contracts <script-name>
```

## Benefits of This Structure

### 1. Scalability ⚡
Adding new packages is now trivial:

```bash
mkdir -p packages/new-package
cat > packages/new-package/package.json <<EOF
{
  "name": "@nostra/new-package",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "@nostra/sdk": "1.0.0"
  }
}
EOF
yarn install
```

Examples of future packages:
- `@nostra/subgraph` - The Graph subgraph for indexing
- `@nostra/cli` - Command-line tools
- `@nostra/docs` - Documentation site
- `@nostra/integration-tests` - E2E tests

### 2. Atomic Updates 🔄
Contracts and SDK are always in sync because they're in the same repo:
- Deploy contracts → Update addresses in SDK → Build SDK
- All in one commit, guaranteed synchronization

### 3. Simplified Dependency Management 📦
- Single `yarn install` for all packages
- Shared dependencies hoisted to root
- Local packages linked automatically

### 4. Better Developer Experience 💻
- Clear separation of concerns
- Type-safe cross-package imports
- Consistent tooling across packages
- Instant changes when editing local packages

### 5. Streamlined CI/CD 🚀
Single pipeline can:
- Compile contracts
- Run tests
- Deploy contracts
- Update SDK with new addresses
- Build and publish SDK
- All in one workflow

## Yarn Workspaces Features

### Automatic Hoisting
Common dependencies are automatically moved to the root `node_modules`:
```
node_modules/
├── ethers/              # Shared by both packages
├── hardhat/             # Only used by contracts
└── typescript/          # Shared by both packages
```

### Automatic Linking
When you reference `@nostra/sdk` from another package, yarn automatically symlinks it:
```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@nostra/sdk": "1.0.0"  // Automatically linked to packages/sdk
  }
}
```

### Workspace Commands
```bash
# Run script in all workspaces
yarn workspaces run build

# Run script in specific workspace
yarn workspace @nostra/contracts test

# List all workspaces
yarn workspaces info
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ All setup complete - ready for development!

### Future Enhancements
1. Set up deployment scripts to auto-update SDK addresses
2. Add script to extract ABIs and copy to SDK
3. Consider adding a subgraph package
4. Add CLI tools package for market management
5. Set up automated npm publishing for SDK

## Verification

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# Compile contracts
yarn compile

# Run all tests
yarn test

# You should see:
# ✅ 77 passing (1s)
```

## Documentation

- **README.md** - Main project documentation
- **SDK_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Architecture decisions and workflow
- **MIGRATION_GUIDE.md** - Migration guide for existing users
- **packages/sdk/README.md** - SDK-specific documentation

## Why Yarn Workspaces?

We chose Yarn Workspaces over alternatives because:

1. **Native Support**: Built into Yarn, no extra tools needed
2. **Widely Adopted**: Used by React, Babel, Jest, and many others
3. **Simple**: Just add `"workspaces": ["packages/*"]` to package.json
4. **Reliable**: Battle-tested in production by major projects
5. **Fast**: Parallel installation and efficient hoisting

### Comparison with Alternatives

| Feature | Yarn Workspaces | npm Workspaces | pnpm | Lerna |
|---------|----------------|----------------|------|-------|
| Built-in | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ (extra tool) |
| Hoisting | ✅ | ✅ | Symlinks | ✅ |
| Speed | Fast | Slower | Fastest | Depends |
| Adoption | Very High | High | Growing | Legacy |
| Complexity | Low | Low | Low | High |
